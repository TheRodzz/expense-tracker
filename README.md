# Expense Tracker

**Open Source & Self-Hostable**  
This project is open source and designed to be self-hosted by anyone who wants full control over their expense data.

---

## üôã Motivation

This project was born out of pure frustration. I used to track my expenses using a Google Sheet hooked up to a Google Form‚Äîit worked well enough, with some graphs and quick entries. But one day, my Google Drive hit its storage limit, and suddenly, I couldn't update anything‚Äînot even my expense tracker. That‚Äôs when it hit me: I needed something better. Something I could fully control. So I built this‚Äîa clean, modern, self-hostable expense tracker that doesn‚Äôt depend on any third-party services, has no storage limits, and gives you full ownership from day one.
